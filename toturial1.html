    <h1>How to Write a Website Requirement Document (WRD)</h1>
    <p>Before you hire a developer on <strong>Romankind</strong>, you need a plan. A Website Requirement Document (WRD) ensures your developer understands your vision, saving you time and money.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Define Your Business Goals</h2>
    <p>Every great website starts with a "Why." Are you selling products? Building a personal brand? Or creating a lead generation tool? Write down your primary goal. For example: "I want to get 10 new customer inquiries per week via a contact form."</p>

    <h2>Step 2: List Your Essential Features</h2>
    <p>Don't just say "I want a website." Be specific about functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Must work perfectly on mobile and desktop.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact Forms:</strong> For users to send details directly to your email.</li>
        <li><strong>Blog/Resources:</strong> To share updates and improve SEO.</li>
        <li><strong>E-commerce:</strong> If you plan to accept payments.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="cta-box">
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> At Romankind, our request form is designed to capture these details automatically for you. <a href="Theam.html">Click here to submit your requirements.</a>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 3: Visual Style and Brand Identity</h2>
    <p>Developers aren't mind readers. Provide examples of websites you like. Mention your preferred color schemes (e.g., "Professional Blue and White") and whether you have a logo ready. This helps the developer calculate the design effort needed.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Technical Preferences</h2>
    <p>If you prefer a specific technology like <strong>Next.js, WordPress, or React</strong>, mention it. If you aren't sure, ask the developer for a recommendation based on your budget and speed requirements.</p>
