    <h1>Custom Websites vs. Templates: 2026 Comparison</h1>
    <p>When starting a new project, many ask: "Should I use a free template or hire a developer for a custom build?" Here is why the choice matters for your business growth.</p>

    <h2>The Problem with Templates</h2>
    <p>Free templates (like those on Wix or basic WordPress) are used by thousands of other people. This makes your brand look generic. Additionally, templates often come with "bloated code," which makes your website load slowly—something Google hates for SEO ranking.</p>

    <h2>The Power of a Custom Build</h2>
    <div class="advantage-card">
        <strong>1. Speed:</strong> Custom sites only include the code you need, making them lightning fast.
    </div>
    <div class="advantage-card">
        <strong>2. SEO:</strong> Developers can optimize the structure specifically for Google search results.

        <strong>3. Scalability:</strong> As your business grows, you can add any feature you want without restrictions.
    </div>

    <h2>Which Should You Choose?</h2>
    <p>If you are just starting a personal hobby blog, a template is fine. However, if you are building a professional business or a service tool like <strong>Romankind</strong>, a custom build is the only way to ensure your site is secure, fast, and unique.</p>
