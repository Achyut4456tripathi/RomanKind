    <h1>Domain Name vs. Web Hosting: A Beginner's Guide</h1>
    <p>If you are planning to build a website with <strong>Romankind</strong>, the first two things you will hear about are "Domains" and "Hosting." While they work together, they are very different services.</p>

    <div class="comparison-box">
        <strong>The House Analogy:</strong> 
        <br>• <strong>Domain:</strong> Your street address (e.g., romankind.in).
        <br>• <strong>Hosting:</strong> The physical house/land where your furniture (files) lives.
    </div>

    <h2>1. What is a Domain Name?</h2>
    <p>A domain name is what users type into their browser to find you. Without a domain, people would have to type a long string of numbers (an IP address) to find your site. In India, a <strong>.com</strong> or <strong>.in</strong> domain typically costs between ₹800 and ₹1,200 per year.</p>

    <h2>2. What is Web Hosting?</h2>
    <p>Web hosting is a service that provides the server space where your website files (images, code, text) are stored. When someone types your domain, the host sends those files to their browser. Common types include Shared Hosting, VPS, and Cloud Hosting (like Vercel).</p>

    <h2>3. Do You Need Both?</h2>
    <p>Yes. You cannot have a live website without both a name and a place to store it. At Romankind, we recommend choosing your domain first to secure your brand name, and then selecting a hosting provider that matches your website's speed requirements.</p>

    <p><em>Pro Tip: Always ensure your domain and hosting are set to "Auto-Renew" so your website never goes offline unexpectedly.</em></p>
    <h2> We don't provide hosting or domain plans this is only for user guide</h2>
